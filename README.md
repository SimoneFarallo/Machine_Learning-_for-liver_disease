# Machine_Learning_for_liver_disease
Classifiers compared for prediction of liver diseases
The purpose of the project is to identify a functional classification model for predictive purposes to determine whether, given certain clinical values, a subject has liver disease. For this purpose, several various classification models were tested to identify the best one.
KNIME (/naÉªm/), the Konstanz Information Miner, is a free and open-source data analytics, reporting and integration platform. KNIME integrates various components for machine learning and data mining through its modular data pipelining "Building Blocks of Analytics" concept. A graphical user interface and use of JDBC allows assembly of nodes blending different data sources, including preprocessing (ETL: Extraction, Transformation, Loading), for modeling, data analysis and visualization without, or with only minimal, programming.
